## How to Optimize the Strawberry Yield
### Self-Pollination

- Method: Strawberries are self-fertile
- Frequency: Daily during flowering period

### Hand Pollination 
- Tools: Small brush or cotton swab
- Technique: Gently brush the center of each flower
- Timing: Mid-morning when flowers are fully open
- Frequency: Every 2-3 days during flowering
